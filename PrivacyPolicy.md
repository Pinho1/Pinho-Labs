### My Audio Spectrum by Pinho Labs

Pinho Labs built the app My Audio Spectrum as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Pinho Labs at no cost and is intended for use as is.

We need the input from your microphone so that we can plot the audio spectrum. After this the garbage collector of your device should erase the data. No data from your microphone gets permanently stored or recorded. It is neither transmitted anywhere. The sound input from your microphone is only ever stored on your device.

We do not use any third party software to collect data on usage. We do collect anonymous crash reports from Google as is provided by the Play Store Service.
